# YACK
Yet Another Collection Kit

YACK is a framework to remotely collect windows forensic items while maintaining powershell 2.0 compatibility. The goal was to ensure maximum compatibility with older versions of Windows. Inspiration drawn from Kansa. 

### Deprecaited
No longer updated due to PS 2.0 constraint being more and more rare.
