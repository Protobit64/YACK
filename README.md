# YACK
Yet Another Collection Kit

YACK was developed to be a framework to remotely collect windows forensic items while maintaining powershell 2.0 compatibility. The goal was to ensure maximum compatibility with older versions of Windows. No longer updated due to PS 2.0 constraint being more and more rare.
